A tutorial project to show Maslow Create works
## Tutorial


Maslow Create is a new kind of CAD program, it is a CAD program which is built on logic instead of drawing. The CAD model is created by connecting logical blocks. Here you can see the most simple form of this where we create a circle, and then connect it to an 'extrude' block which makes it 3D.


The logical elements which we can connect together are referred to as 'Atoms'. A number of atom can be joined together to form a new logical element called a 'Molecule'. Double click on a molecule to see and edit it's structure 


## Molecule


Each atom has 0 or more inputs and 1 output. 


A molecule can contain any amount of logic, but only logic attached to the output will be used


Click on the molecule here to see some more examples


## Molecules can have names too

The area in the lower right corner of the screen contains information about the currently selected atom. Some values may be editable if you click on them
